LilyTwinkle Protosnap

Based on the LilyTwinkle board, the LilyTwinkle Protosnap
includes everything needed to make a twinkling starscape.

The board includes four LilyPad LED boards, a LilyTwinkle,
and a coin cell holder with a switch on it. This git
repository only includes the design files; the firmware
can be found in the LilyTiny-LilyTwinkle repo.
